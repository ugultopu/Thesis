-Use lots of graphics (photos, figures, etc.).
-Sometimes, list stuff using a bullet list, instead of mentioning about them in a paragraph. Example: The bullet list on Page 6 of the article "A Search-Based Approach for Generating Angry Birds Levels.pdf". Another example of the same kind in Page 2 of the same paper.

Malcolm Heywood's recommendations:

  In Results section, talk about the issues that came up. What were the problem cases, how you dealt with them? Like, "if this function didn't exist, that was going to happen".

  Spare around 5 pages for literature review.

  The appendix (say "Appendix A") can contain screenshots from all your levels.
